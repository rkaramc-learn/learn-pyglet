# Pyglet Readme

A simple repository created to explore and build a first application with the **pyglet** graphics engine.

## Getting Started

This project uses `uv` for dependency management.

### Installation

```bash
uv sync
```

### Running the Application

You can run the main entry point using:

```bash

```
